# Facade Design Pattern
The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified and unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use, hiding its complexities. The Facade pattern promotes loose coupling between the client and the subsystem by providing a single entry point to access the subsystem's functionality.

# Intent

* Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
* Define a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
* Promote loose coupling and simplify the interaction between a client and a subsystem.

# Implementation
* **Subsystem Classes:** Classes that represent the subsystem, each responsible for specific parts of the functionality.
* **Facade:** A class that provides a simplified, higher-level interface to the subsystem. It delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.

# Example in Java

Here is a simple example of how to implement the Facade design pattern in Java:

* [**Order**](https://github.com/sidhant97/DesignDoctrine/tree/main/facade)

# Use Cases
* Simplifying the usage of a complex system or library.
* Creating a higher-level interface for a set of related subsystems.
* Promoting loose coupling between clients and subsystems.

# Pros
* Simplifies the client's interaction with a complex system. 
* Hides the details of subsystems, promoting encapsulation.
* Reduces dependencies between clients and subsystems.

# Cons
* May lead to a "fat" facade that becomes too complex itself.
* May not be suitable if clients need fine-grained control over subsystems.

# Conclusion
The Facade Design Pattern is valuable when dealing with complex systems, providing a unified and simplified interface for clients. It helps manage and abstract the complexities of subsystems, promoting encapsulation and loose coupling. Facades are particularly beneficial in scenarios where clients should interact with a system through a higher-level interface rather than directly with individual subsystem components.
